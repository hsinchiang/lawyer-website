## Q1: Is there a fee for the consultation?
We offer a **complimentary initial 15-minute phone evaluation**. For in-depth face-to-face meetings or detailed case analysis, our standard rate is NT$ 3,000 per hour. If you choose to formally retain our services afterward, the consultation fee can be fully credited toward your retainer.

## Q2: How long does a typical lawsuit take?
This depends on the complexity of the case. Generally, simple cases take about 3–6 months, while standard procedures may take 8 months to over a year. We strive to help you achieve the most efficient resolution possible.

## Q3: I am not located in Taipei. Can I still retain your services?
Absolutely! We handle cases across all of Taiwan. With the increasing digitalization of court systems and our ability to hold video conferences for case discussions, distance is not an obstacle.
