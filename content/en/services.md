## I. Schedule of Fees

**Legal Consultation** is the first step to solving a problem. 
Through consultation, a lawyer can preliminarily assess the probability of winning the case and the direction of handling. We recommend bringing relevant documents for precise analysis.

**Retainer Fees** usually include drafting pleadings, court appearances, and negotiations with the opposing party. 
For more complex cases (such as construction disputes or medical litigation), fees may be adjusted accordingly, but will always be disclosed in advance.

> "The law does not protect those who sleep on their rights."
>> The statute of limitations under the Civil Code is crucial; please stay informed.
