## Case Overview

The client, Mr. Lin (pseudonym), saw an advertisement on Facebook for "Free AI Stock Market Tutorials." After joining a LINE group, he was brainwashed by the persuasive tactics of the group's "Teacher" and "Teaching Assistant." Believing them implicitly, Mr. Lin gradually transferred his retirement savings—totaling NT$2 million—into a "trading platform app" specified by the fraud syndicate.

Initially, the account showed staggering profits. However, when Mr. Lin attempted to withdraw his funds, the platform's customer service created various obstacles, citing "security deposits" and "tax issues." Eventually, Mr. Lin was kicked out of the group. Realizing he had been scammed, he urgently sought assistance from Attorney A-Bo-Bo.

> **Red Flags of the Scam:**
> 1. Guarantees of high returns with zero risk.
> 2. Operations conducted via unknown apps or URLs.
> 3. Requirements to transfer more money when attempting to withdraw funds.

## Legal Strategy & Proceedings

### Step 1: Emergency Stop-Payment and Police Report
Upon being retained, Attorney A-Bo-Bo immediately assisted in organizing remittance records and chat screenshots. We guided the client to file a report at the police station and simultaneously notified the bank for an "Emergency Stop-Payment (Circle Deposit)." We successfully had the syndicate's mule accounts designated as "Alert Accounts," freezing a portion of the funds.

### Step 2: Defense in Criminal Investigation Hearings
Once the case reached the District Prosecutors Office, although the masterminds (overseas call centers) were difficult to track, we successfully identified the "Money Mules" and "Nominee Account Holders" who provided the accounts. During the investigation hearings, the attorney strongly asserted that the defendants should be held criminally liable for "Aiding and Abetting Fraud" and "Money Laundering," exerting significant psychological pressure on the defendants.

### Step 3: Mediation and Compensation
Under the attorney's negotiation strategy, the defendants agreed to enter mediation with the victim to seek a suspended sentence or a lighter penalty.

// Negotiation Highlights
Attorney's Argument: If no compensation is paid, we will pursue criminal charges and supplementary civil claims. The defendants would face imprisonment while still being liable for the debt.
Outcome: The defendants agreed to a settlement to compensate Mr. Lin's losses in installments.
