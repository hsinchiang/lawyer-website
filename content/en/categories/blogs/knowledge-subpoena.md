## Sudden Official Notice Leaving You Shaken?

For many people, seeing an envelope from the District Prosecutors Office or the Court for the first time is overwhelming. Your mind might go blank, worrying about whether you're headed for prison.
First, take a deep breath. Receiving a subpoena does not necessarily mean you are guilty, but **you must never ignore it**.

Attorney A-Bo-Bo has summarized three steps to help you respond calmly:

### Step 1: Identify Your "Status"

Open the subpoena and check the status listed next to the "Summoned Person" field:

1.  **Defendant**: This means someone has filed a complaint against you, or the prosecutor suspects you of a crime. In this case, it is highly recommended to **consult a lawyer immediately** to discuss the case and defense strategy.
2.  **Witness**: This means you may have witnessed the incident or possess inside information.
    * *Note: Witnesses have a legal duty to testify. Failing to appear without a valid reason may result in fines or even being taken into custody by force (arrest).*
3.  **Interested Party / Complainant**: Typically someone assisting in clarifying the facts of the case.

### Step 2: Confirm the "Location"

* **District Prosecutors Office (Investigation Room)**:
    Usually occurs at the early stage of a case. The prosecutor conducts proceedings privately. This is the **golden window to strive for a "Ruling Not to Prosecute" (Non-indictment)**.
* **Court (Trial Chamber)**:
    This means the case has been indicted and has entered the judicial trial stage. These are usually public hearings and require more rigorous legal arguments.

### Step 3: Check the "Cause of Action" and "Time"

The subpoena will usually list a cause of action such as "Fraud" or "Injury by Negligence."
If you don't recall the incident, you can call the **Court Clerk** (extension number is on the subpoena) to inquire. However, clerks are usually tight-lipped and won't reveal too many details.

> **Common Myth: I'm busy that day, can I skip it?**
> Unless you have a legitimate reason (e.g., severe illness, being abroad), you **must file for leave** with supporting evidence. It only counts if the prosecutor or judge approves it. Failure to appear without cause could lead to a warrant being issued for your arrest!

## A Message from the Attorney

{{< theorem "Speak with Caution" >}}
Every word spoken in court is recorded in the official transcript and serves as the basis for the future judgment.
If you are the **Defendant**, do not admit to anything or over-explain before reviewing the case files and understanding the evidence held by the opposing party.

We recommend bringing your subpoena and relevant documents to consult with a lawyer before your court date. Let us help you simulate the hearing to avoid saying the wrong thing and living with regret.
