## Case Overview

The client, Mr. Chen (pseudonym), leased an apartment in Taipei City to a tenant. Initially, rent was paid on time; however, after six months, the tenant began using excuses to delay payments and eventually stopped answering calls and messages. The total rent arrears exceeded six months.

Mr. Chen attempted to resolve the issue in person but found the door locked. Worried that changing the locks himself might violate laws regarding "Coercion" or "Trespassing," leaving him helpless against the squatter, he entrusted our firm to handle the matter.

## Legal Strategy & Proceedings

### Step 1: Issuing a Formal Demand Letter (Termination of Contract)
Legal procedures rely on evidence. Attorney A-Bo-Bo first assisted in sending a "Formal Demand Letter" (Legal Notice), setting a reasonable deadline for the tenant to pay the arrears. Once the deadline passed, we issued a notice to "Terminate the Lease Agreement" in accordance with Article 440 of the Civil Code, effectively stripping the tenant of their legal right to possession.

### Step 2: Filing a Lawsuit for Eviction and Recovery of Premises
As the tenant continued to ignore the situation, we immediately filed a lawsuit for "Eviction and Recovery of Premises" and "Payment of Rent Arrears."
In court, the attorney presented the complete lease agreement, remittance records, and the return receipt of the formal demand letter. After review, the judge swiftly rendered a **favorable judgment** for Mr. Chen.

### Step 3: Application for Compulsory Execution
Despite the judgment, the tenant refused to vacate. The attorney immediately applied to the Civil Execution Department of the Court for "Compulsory Execution."
Accompanied by a Court Clerk and local police officers, a locksmith was called to open the door. After an inventory of the items inside, the tenant's possession was officially terminated, and the property was formally handed back to Mr. Chen.
